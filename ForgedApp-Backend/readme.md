We've build the docker container and deployed it Container-optimized VM images of google cloud to serve our app in scale.


Note: Sadly we ran out our Google Cloud 300$ during testiong of our app. So, we're using some other cloud providers. Hope we'll get some free Google cloud credits 
for demo day(if we got selected).
