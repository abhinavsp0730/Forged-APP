## Problems 

* On social media platforms ,  photographs are manipulated and are used in a very improper way with bad intentions . 
* Forensic documents like Adhar cards , driving license , pan cards etc are manipulated . 
* Elections shape the results using photos manipulation .
* Advertisements are manipulated to mislead customers . 
* Womenâ€™s intimate pictures are morphed . 
* Celebrities are trolled by blending the pictures with some useless stuffs.

## Our Solutions

* We can simply just upload the image on our app or on our website , then our app will predict whether the image is manipulated or not even you will get to know about the portion being manipulated . 
* This will definitely help you to be aware of the  cyber crimes which happens for intentionally worst purposes . 
* On TWITTER , our twitter bot  platform will help you to get to the forged image of the actual image .

You can get the images verified and be aware of the morphing the images .
